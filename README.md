# To-Do List & TimerPomodoro üéì

Program consists of two parts:

## ToDo List ‚úÖ
In the ToDo List, the user can:
- Enter and add tasks to the list (tasks are entered in a text field and can be submitted using a button or the Enter key). If the user doesn't enter any tasks, the program will display a message.
- Select and delete tasks from the list.
- Save tasks to a `tasks.dat` file. If the user tries to save an empty task list, the program will display a message.
- When the user clicks the X button (to close the window), the program will display a message asking whether the user wants to save changes before exiting. If the user tries to save an empty task list, the program will notify them.

## Timer Pomodoro ‚è∞
The TimerPomodoro is a timer that counts down a 25-minute work session, followed by a 5-minute break. After 4 work sessions, there is a 15-minute break, and so on. After each 25-minute countdown, the program plays a short sound to indicate the start of a break.
The user can reset the timer or skip the current countdown.

**NOTE:**
Before running the program, it is recommended to download the `tasks.dat` file, which already contains sample tasks to display, although it is not necessary.
